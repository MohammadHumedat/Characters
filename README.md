# 🧠 Flutter Clean Architecture Learning App

A complete **Flutter learning project** built to demonstrate best practices for:

- Fetching data from APIs
- Using **BLoC/Cubit** for state management
- Implementing the **Repository pattern**
- Organizing code with **clean architecture**
- Applying **router navigation** for screens
- Adding **search functionality**
- Using **Hero animations** for smooth navigation transitions
- Customizing **SliverAppBar** for better UX
- Following clean **linting rules** and project conventions

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Fetch data from REST API using **Dio / WebServices layer**  
✅ Manage state using **BLoC / Cubit**  
✅ Organize project with **Repository Pattern**  
✅ Navigation via **AppRouters class**  
✅ Implement **Search** filter inside GridView  
✅ Add **Hero widget** for transition between Character list and details  
✅ Beautiful **SliverAppBar** in details screen  
✅ Handle loading, success, and error states gracefully  
✅ Clean, modular, and readable project structure  
✅ Proper **lint rules** configuration in `analysis_options.yaml`

This structure follows **Clean Architecture principles**:

- **WebServices** → responsible for API calls
- **Repository** → connects data layer and business logic
- **Cubit/BLoC** → handles states and logic
- **Presentation** → displays data in UI

## ⚙️ Technologies & Packages

| Package                | Purpose                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `flutter_bloc`         | State management               |
| `dio`                  | API networking                 |
| `equatable`            | Easier Cubit state comparisons |
| `cached_network_image` | Efficient image loading        |
| `flutter_lints`        | Enforcing code style           |
| `google_fonts`         | Custom typography              |
| `animations`           | For Hero and transitions       |

## 🔍 Search Feature

Users can search for characters by name (case-insensitive).  
It filters results dynamically inside the `GridView` using Cubit state updates.

---

## 🎨 UI Highlights

- **CharactersScreen**: Displays all characters in a responsive grid
- **CharacterItem**: Card with image, name, and status indicator
- **CharacterDetailsScreen**: Opens with smooth Hero transition + SliverAppBar
- **Error & Loading states** handled elegantly using widgets
- Consistent spacing, rounded corners, and shadows for a clean look

---

## 🧩 Routing

App navigation is managed by `AppRouters`:

```dart
switch (settings.name) {
  case ConstantStrings.characterScreen:
    return MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (_) => BlocProvider(
        create: (context) => CharacterCubit(repository),
        child: const CharactersScreen(),
      ),
    );
  case ConstantStrings.characterScreenDetails:
    return MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (_) => const CharactersDetails(),
    );
}

## State Management:
- **Each feature has its own Cubit class (e.g. CharacterCubit) that:

- **Fetches data via Repository

- **Emits Loading → Success → Error states

- **Allows filtering (search)

## How To Run This Project:-
** Clone the repository:
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/Characters.git

** Navigate to project folder
- cd Characters

- flutter pub get
- flutter run


##🎓 Learning Goals

-This project is perfect for anyone who wants to:

-Learn Flutter + BLoC/Cubit from real example

-Understand Clean Architecture pattern

-Practice API fetching + Repository separation

-Master navigation, search, and hero animation

-Write clean and lint-approved Flutter code
